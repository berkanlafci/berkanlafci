I work on 3D geometry processing and learning-based mesh generation, with a focus on building algorithms that move from research into production systems.

My background spans 3D reconstruction, constrained optimization, and generative models for geometry. I have led the development and deployment of machine learning models that expanded real-world system capabilities and are now used in production workflows at scale.

I am particularly interested in closing the loop between algorithm design and real-world usage, translating failure modes and user feedback into robust model and optimization improvements.

I hold a Ph.D. from ETH Zurich in Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, with prior degrees from the Technical University of Munich and Boğaziçi University.
